Raspberry Pi Motion Detection using OpenCV/Python
===
Adaptation of code from
(http://thorbek.net/online/2014/05/27/a-simple-motion-detection-program-for-raspberry-pi/).
I have changed the code to get the motion detection frames from the
video port at a lower resolution, and to snap a high resolution shot
when motion is detected.
